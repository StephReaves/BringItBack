### About Bring It Back

Bring It Back is an application that enables and individual to propose a product, item, or services that was discountinued that they would like to bring back. Think Change.org, but for everyday consumer products and services. 

I used Sintra, ActiveRecord with associations, Bootstrap, HTML5, and JavaScript (AJAX & JQuery) as the stack for this application. The application is implemented with authentication, error handling, and user permissions.
